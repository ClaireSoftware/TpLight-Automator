# TpLight-Automator

TpLight-Automator is a simple script to enable command-line simplified management of various tp-link lightbulbs. Currently, only on/off support is implemented, using [tplink-lightbulb](https://github.com/konsumer/tplink-lightbulb)'s CLI interface. Plans are in the work to add color support, and support for TP-Link smart switches.

## Installation

use NPM to install tplink-lightbulb, git clone this script, run the script
